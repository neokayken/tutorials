Getting started flask
----

- Install Python in short

first you need a python installed. 
Many Linux distributions and MacOS have it but for Windows you need to install it yourself.
it is easy you go to Python Website and click download and then install it.

- Virtual Environment

it is better to have a virtual environment. there are several python virtual environment you can choose from. 
but simply venv comes with the basic python packages it is recommended since python version 3.3.
conda is a good choice too. if you look for a lightweight virtual environment miniconda would be resonable.
version control in conda is good as well.

Some wants to dockerize it. it is fine to docker it. 
what matters is to contain the runtime and version control.
